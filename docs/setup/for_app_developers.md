# Install and Launch for App Developers

At version 1.0, QuickView is expected to be installed and used from
a personal computer with the data files also being local.
Future versions will support the server-client model allowing access
to remote data.

Releases so far have focused on macOS. Support for
more systems will be added in the near [future](../future.md).
