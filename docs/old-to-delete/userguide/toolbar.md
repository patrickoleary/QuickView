![toolbar](../../images/toolbar.png)

The toolbar located at the top of the GUI contains UI elements (buttons and text
boxes) that control global features of the current visualization session,
"global" in the sense that they affect the overall appearance and state of the
GUI, including all views of physical quantities displayed in the
[viewport](viewport.md). In the following, we first explain in detail the UI
elements that support the two modes of usage of the app, new-viz and resume, and
then introduce the other elements.

## New-viz mode: starting a new visualization

![connectivity and data file selection](../../images/toolbar_conn_and_data_load.png){
width="59%", align=right }

To start a new analysis/visualization, the user needs to specify a connecitivy
file and a simulation data file using the portion of the toolbar shown here, by
either pasting/typing the file paths and names in the corresponding boxes or
using the file folder icons to bring up system dialogue windows to select files.

![green circle](../../images/toolbar_circle_green.png){ width="5%", align=right
} ![red circle](../../images/toolbar_circle_red.png){ width="5%", align=right }

After both files have been specified, the `Load Files` button next to the
`Data File` box (i.e., the icon of a page with a check mark) must be clicked. If
the red circle with an exclamation mark shown in the picture here becomes a
green circle with a check mark, the files have been loaded and the ParaView
Reader behind the GUI has identified variables in the data file that the app can
visualize. The user can then start using the [control panel](control_panel.md)
to select variables and spatial/temporal slices to display.

!!! warning "Tip: File Loading Error"

    After the `Load Files` button is clicked,
    if the red circle-and-exclamation icon persists,
    then the variable dimensions in the data file
    are not parsed correctly. Below are some common reasons for the error:

    - The data file and the connectivity file correspond to different cubed-sphere
      grids. E.g., one is ne30pg2 and the other is ne4pg2.
    - The data file is missing some of the coordinate variables needed by the
      app, or the dimensions are named or ordered in ways not yet known by
      the app, see [data format requirements](data_requirements.md).

## Resume mode: pick up where you left off

![state save and load](../../images/toolbar_state_save_and_load.png){
width="10%", align=right }

The current state of the visualization can be saved—and reloaded later to resume
the analysis—using the `Save State` (downward arrow) and `Load State` (upward
arrow) buttons shown here.

For loading a state, the upward arrow button brings up a window for the user to
select a state file from the computer. After the file is selected and the `Open`
button in that dialogue window is clicked, the app will immediately start
loading the state; the user is _not_ supposed to click on the Load Files button
designed for the new-viz scenario. If the state file is successfully loaded (the
contents are correctly parsed), the red circle-and-exclamation icon will turn
into to a green circle-and-check-mark icon, like in the new-viz mode. Loading a
state for an ne30 simulation usually takes a couple of seconds.

!!! info "Info: What's in a State File?"

    A state file is a JSON file that contains the paths and names of
    the connectivity and data files being used as well as the settings
    the user has chosen for the visualization; the *contents* of the
    connectivity and data files are *not* included.
    If a state file is shared among multiple users or used across different
    file systems, or if a user wants to apply the same visualization settings
    to a different simulation data file, then the file names and paths
    at the beginning of the state file need to be edited before the state
    file is loaded in the app.

!!! warning "Tip: State File Loading Error"

    If the app seems nonresponsive after a state file has been chosen
    and the `Open` button in the dialogue window has been clicked,
    there is a high chance that the paths and names of
    the connectivity and simulation data files contain errors.
    The user should consider using a text editor to inspect the first
    few lines of the state file and verify correctness.

## Other elements of the toolbar

![hamburger icon](../../images/toolbar_hamburger.png){ width="6%", align=right }

**Control Panel Hide/Show**: The hamburger icon (three stacked lines) at the
left end of the toolbar hides or shows the [control panel](control_panel.md).

![busy indicator](../../images/toolbar_busy_indicator.png){ width="5%",
align=right }

**Busy Indicator**: The gray circle is a busy indicator. When a rotating segment
appears, the app is processing data in the background—for example, loading data
files or a state file as explained earlier on this page, or loading newly
selected variables (see description of the [control panel](control_panel.md)).

![LOAD VARIABLES button](../../images/toolbar_load_variables.png){ width="18%",
align=right }

**`LOAD VARIABLES`**: The `LOAD VARIABLES` button, when clicked, executes the
action of loading the [user-selected variables](control_panel.md) from the data
file and displaying them in the [viewport](viewport.md).

![colormap groups](../../images/toolbar_colormap_groups.png){ width="12%",
align=right }

**Colormap Groups**: The eye icon is a toggle for loading a group of
colorblind-friendly colormaps to the GUI for the user to choose from in the
[viewport](viewport.md); A lot of these colormaps are from
[Crameri, F. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862). The paint palette
icon is a toggle for loading a set of colormaps that may not be
colorblind-friendly; Currently, these are "presets" from
[PareView](https://www.paraview.org/).

![camera actions](../../images/toolbar_camera_actions.png){ width="25%",
align=right }

**Camera Actions**: A set of buttons are provided to simultaneously adjust all
views in the [viewport](viewport.md): move them up, down, left, or right with
respect to the GUI, zoom in or out, or refresh all contents in the
[viewport](viewport.md) so that the contour plots are recentered and resized to
their individual frames.

!!! tip "Tip: Camera Refresh for Addressing Display Error"

    ![camera reset](../../images/toolbar_camera_reset.png){ width="6%", align=right }

    As mentioned on the [Reminders](reminders.md) page, the app may exhibit
    display issues after new variables are loaded or when visualization
    settings are changed.
    In those cases, a click on the `Camera Reset` button at the right end
    of the tool bar should reload the visualization
    properly, and we are working on resolving the display problem for future releases.
