# Viewport

![Four views](../../images/viewport_four_views.png){ width="50%", align=right }

Once the user has selected variables using the [control panel](control_panel.md)
and clicked the `LOAD VARIABLES` button in the [toolbar](toolbar.md), the app
will show each variable in its own little frame (which we refer to as a "view")
inside the viewport. On the right is an example showing four views.

Within each view, the variable name is noted together with the indices of the
vertical level (if applicable) and time slice being displayed, and the
area-weighted global average on that vertical level. If the "area" variable is
not present in the data file, then the arithmetic average is calculated and
displayed.

## Custimizing the viewport

![Many views resized and rearranged](../../images/viewport_many_views_rearranged.png){
width="50%", align=right}

To help present multiple variables in an informative way, the app allows users
to

- rearrange the views via ^^drag-and-drop^^, and
- resize each view separately by clicking and dragging its ^^bottom-right
  corner^^.

The screenshot on the right shows an example with rearranged views.

Furthermore, if a user saves a state file after these adjustments, they can
later continue their analysis with the customized layout by using the app in the
resume mode, as described in on the description of the [toolbar](toolbar.md).

## Custimizing individual views

Each view can be further customized individually by clicking on the gear button
in the bottom-left corner of the view. The click brings up a mini menu as shown
in the examples below.

The mini menu contains options to control various properties of the view: a
dropdown menu for colormap selection, checkboxes to turn on/off logarithmic
scale and to invert/restore the color sequence, text boxes for changing the
minimum and maximum values for color mapping, and a button to reset the color
mapping to fit the value range of data slice.

!!! tip "Tip: Automatic or Fixed Colormap Ranges"

    By default, the app will automatically span the colormap over the range of values
    of the current time slice and vertical level. The maximum and minimum values can be found
    in the mini menu, as seen in the left example shown above.
    When the "play" button in the [control panel](control_panel.md) is used to cycle
    through different data slices,
    the colormap is automatically re-adjusted to fit the data range of each slice.

    If the user specifies maximum and/or minimum values in the mini menu, a blue icon
    with a picture of a lock and the text "Manual" will appear above the maximum
    value, as can be seen on the right in the example shown above.
    In such a case, when the "play" button in the [control panel](control_panel.md)
    is used to cycle through different data slices,
    the colormap will be fixed to the user-specified range.

!!! tip "Tip: Field Value Lookup in Colorbar"

    ![colorbar hover over](../../images/colorbar_hover_over.png){ width="55%", align=right }

    If the user hovers their cursor over a colorbar, the corresponding field
    value will be displayed, as shown by the example here.

!!! tip "Tip: Colormap Groups"

    The [toolbar](toolbar.md) at the top of the GUI includes icons for two colormap
    groups: colorblind-friendly and other. Only the colormaps belonging to the
    selected group (or groups) are shown in the `Color Map` drop-down menu
    brought up by the gear button.
