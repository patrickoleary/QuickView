# The QuickView tool family at NERSC

Our tools have been installed at NERSC,
the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center](https://www.nersc.gov/),
and are continually updated there.
The following sections on this page contain instructions for users who would like to
**use** our installations **for analysis**.

[[toc]]

Users who are interested in the installation itself can find relevant information
on separate pages:
- How our public installation was done: see [this page](./public_installation).
- How to install your own copy at NERSC: see [this example](./users_installation.md).
- How to install the tools on a laptop or desktop computer: see [this page](/guides/install_and_launch).

## Quickstart for users familiar with JupyterHub

- Login to [JupytherHub](https://jupyter.nersc.gov/hub/login) and start a terminal window.

- *Optional but recommended*: in the terminal, use the `cd` command to go to the directory
  where your data files are located (or a directory closer to the data files than your home directory).
  While this step is optional, it may save you quite some clicks later in the graphical UI.

- QuickView version 2 can be launched using the following command:
```
/global/common/software/m4359/quickview2
```  

- QuickCompare can be launched using the following command:
```
/global/common/software/m4359/quickcompare
```

- After a few seconds, the terminal window will say "Use URL below to connect to the application:"
  and show a URL starting.
  A click on the URL will bring up the graphical UI in a brower window.

::: tip Tip 1: Choosing a server for your analysis session.
JupyterHub's control panel offers to NERSC users serveral different types of resources (nodes)
for their computing and analyais needs, including, e.g., login node, shared GPU node,
exclusive nodes, as explained in [NERSC's documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/reference/).

Since login nodes are shared by users and hence can get very busy or run into memory constraints,
and since our tools can make use of GPUs for interactive rendering,
**we recommend** that users choose a **shared GPU node**.

Keep in mind, though, that time spent on shared GPU nodes or exclusive nodes
will be charged to your project's allocation.
:::

::: tip Tip 2: The same executables work for all types of nodes.
Regardless of which type of node is chosen, the same commands (as listed above)
are used to launch our tools in the QuickView family.
:::

::: tip Tip 3: No need for manual `module load conda`.
When one of the commands provided above is used to launch tools in the QuickView family,
there is no need to manually apply `module load conda` or activate the environment
that our tools are installed in. This is because the above-mentioned commands are
in fact scripts that have included those steps.
:::

::: warning ATTENTION: Shut down the server when you are done!
After finishing your analysis, please remember to shut down the connection to your
assigned node to avoid keeping the resource idle and unnecessarily charging
to your project's allocation. This is explained at the end of
[this video](https://docs.nersc.gov/beginner-guide/#keypad-entry-log-in-using-jupyter).
Also see below for a recap of the steps (clicks).
:::

### Shuting down a servier in JupyterHub

- Go to the JupytherHub window/tab in your browser.
- Click on `File` in the top-left corner.
- Scroll down and choose `Hub Control Panel`.
- In the Control Panel brought up in a new browser tab or window,
  click on the red "stop" button for the server to be shut down.
  An example is shown in the screenshot below.

## For NERSC users who have not used JupyterHub

Please see
[this section of NERSC's documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/beginner-guide/#keypad-entry-log-in-using-jupyter),
especially the video "How to log in to Perlmutter with Jupyter",
to learn about the service.
