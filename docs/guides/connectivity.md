# Connectivity files

::: tip "Tip: Connecitivity File Download"

A collection of connectivity files can
be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16908566). The archive is
continually updated as more users inform us about the grids their data files
use.
:::

The horizontal grids used by EAM are cubed spheres. Since these are unstructed
grids, QuickView needs to know how to map data to the globe. Therefore, for each
simulation data file, a "connectivity file" needs to be provided.

In EAMv2, v3, and v4, most of the variables (physical quantities) are written
out on a "physics grid" (also referred to as "physgrid", "FV grid", or "control
volume mesh") described in
[Hannah et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002419). The naming
convention for such grids is `ne*pg2`, with `*` being a number, e.g., 4, 30,
120, 256. Further details about EAM's cubed-sphere grids can be found in EAM's
documentation, for example in
[this overview](https://e3sm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/34113147/SE+Atmosphere+Grid+Overview+EAM+CAM)
and
[this description](https://e3sm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/872579110/Running+E3SM+on+New+Atmosphere+Grids).

Future versions of QuickView will also support the cubed-sphere meshes used by
EAM's dynamical core, i.e., the `ne*np4` grids (also referred to as "native
grids" or "GLL grids").

## Generate connectivity files

Users can generate connectivity files with
[`TempestRemap`](https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestremap)
([Ullrich and Taylor, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-14-00343.1);
[Ullrich et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0301.1)) using
[this script](https://github.com/mt5555/remap-ncl/blob/master/makeSE.sh) shared
by Mark A. Taylor at Sandia National Laboratories. (`TempestRemap` is available
as a part of the [`E3SM-Unified`](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/e3sm-unified)
conda environment. It can also be installed following the instructions provided
in its [repo](https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestremap).)

For example, using Mark's script, the command

```
./makeSE.sh 30
```

will generate several different files for the `ne30pg2` grid, including, e.g.,

- `TEMEPST_NE30pg2.g` (Exodus format),
- `TEMPEST_ne30pg2.scrip.nc` (SCRIP format).

QuickView uses the **SCRIP** format.
